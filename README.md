# Student_Data-_Analysis-

This project involves analyzing a self-created mini student dataset using SQL. The dataset consists of a single table (student_edge) with 7 columns, designed to simulate real-world student academic data.

Using this table, various basic and intermediate-level SQL operations are performed, such as:

Data retrieval (SELECT)

Filtering (WHERE, LIKE)

Sorting (ORDER BY)

Grouping and aggregation (GROUP BY, HAVING)

Subqueries

Pattern matching

Identifying duplicates and unique values

The goal is to strengthen SQL fundamentals by writing queries to solve practical questions and extract meaningful insights from the dataset.
